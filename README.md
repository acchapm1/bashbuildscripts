***Bash Build Scripts Project
**Overview
This project contains a set of bash scripts that are used to automate the process of building and installing software packages from source code.
Note: The scripts are designed for use on Unix-based systems.

**Structure
Scripts in this project include the configuration, building, and installation of software packages.

variables.source: A source file that contains environment variable declarations required for a specific software package.

configure_script.sh: A bash script that configures the package for installation.

build_script.sh: A bash script that builds the software package from the source code.

install_script.sh: A bash script that installs the compiled software package to a specific directory.

**Usage
To use these scripts:

Define your environment variables in the variables.source file, making sure to set the package name, version, and any dependencies.

Run the configure_script.sh to configure the software package for installation.

After configuration, execute build_script.sh to build the software package.

Finally, run install_script.sh to install the software package to a specified directory.

**Requirements
The scripts require a Unix-based system with a bash shell and installed development tools.
Important: Always inspect scripts downloaded from the internet before running them to ensure they are safe.
